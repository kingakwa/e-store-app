## Prerequisites:

-Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can get it from the official website. npm comes bundled with it.
-Git: You'll need Git to manage the code.
-A Code Editor: I recommend Visual Studio Code.

## Installation
- Clone the Repository: Open your terminal (or command prompt), navigate to where you want to store the project, and run:
  
 ```
git clone <your-github-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```
## Install Dependencies:
The package.json file lists all the tools the project needs (like Vite and Tailwind CSS). Install them by running:
The VS Code terminal will then automatically recognize the node and npm commands after the installation is complete.

**Step 1: Download the Node.js Installer**
-Open your web browser and go to the official Node.js website: `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`

-You will see two download options:
  -LTS (Long-Term Support): This is the recommended version for most users. It's stable and has been tested extensively.
  -Current: This version includes the latest features but may be less stable
-Download the `LTS Windows Installer` (.msi file).

**Step 2: Run the Installer**
-Run the downloaded .msi file.
-The installation wizard will guide you through the process. You can generally accept the default options as they are suitable for most users. The installer will automatically add Node.js and npm to your system's PATH.

-Click `Next` through the prompts, and then click `Install` to begin the installation.

**Step 3: Verify the Installation**
-After the installation is complete, close and reopen your VS Code terminal. This step is crucial for the changes to your system's PATH to take effect.
-In the new terminal, run the following commands to verify that both Node.js and npm are installed correctly:
```
node -v
npm -v    #If the commands return version numbers (e.g., v18.16.0 for Node.js and 9.5.1 for npm)
```

- **Run**
- `yarn` or `npm install` to install packages
-
